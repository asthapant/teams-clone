# Video Calling Platform

This is a video calling platform designed and developed in **NodeJs** using **simple-peer WebRTC** and deployed on **Heroku**. It allows two users to video call simultaneously with additional feature of showing or stopping video, muting or unmuting audio, inviting people onboard or applying filters to one's own video without the other user knowing it.

The application link can be shared to the other person thereby facilitating a real time video connection.
